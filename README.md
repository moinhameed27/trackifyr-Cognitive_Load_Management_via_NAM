# trackifyr: AI-Based Cognitive Load Estimation via Natural Activity Monitoring

**Final Year Project (FYP) – Phase I**

trackifyr is an intelligent AI system designed to estimate cognitive load in real-time by analyzing natural user activities during digital work and study sessions. Unlike traditional digital wellbeing tools that only measure screen time, trackifyr uses multimodal behavioral signals (facial expressions, gaze patterns, keyboard, and mouse interactions) to classify cognitive load into three categories: **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**.

This repository contains the complete Phase-I development work, including requirement analysis, activity tracking implementation, web dashboard prototype, and initial system architecture.

## 📚 Research Contributions

### Research Gaps Addressed
- Most prior studies are dataset-driven rather than building end-to-end usable systems
- Many focus on intrusive physiological sensors (EEG, ECG)
- Approaches often restricted to controlled lab environments

### Our Contribution
- **Natural activity monitoring** using webcam, keyboard, and mouse during normal digital work
- **Real-time automatic detection** using multimodal features
- **Actionable feedback** (break reminders) instead of only data labeling
- **Practical tools**: Desktop app for activity capture and web dashboard for visualization
